Attributes are always applied to an element (e.g. a method, property). 


using System.Reflection;
[assembly:AssemblyTitle("My Assembly")]

It specifies that the attribute applies to the assembly itself, and not to any of the types within the assembly. Some other attribute targets are module, return and param.
